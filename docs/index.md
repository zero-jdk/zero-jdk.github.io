### Local Development

```bash
# Initialize your project with a specific JDK version
$ zjdk init --version temurin-17.0.8
# Create the zjdk wrapper script - think of gradlew, mvnw
$ zjdk wrapper

# Commit both configuration and wrapper to version control
$ git add .zjdk/ zjdkw
$ git commit -m "Add Zero JDK configuration and wrapper"

# Clone project and use the wrapper
$ git clone https://github.com/example/java-project.git
$ cd java-project
$ ./zjdkw sync  # Downloads and sets up the project's required JDK

# Check what's configured using the wrapper
$ ./zjdkw info
Version:       21.0.7 (21 - 21.0.7+6)
Identifier(s): temurin-21.0.7
Support:       LTS

$ ./zjdkw env  # Prints shell commands to set up environment variables
```

### CI / CD Pipelines

```bash
# Inside your CI/CD script:
$ ./zjdkw sync
$ eval "$(./zjdkw env)"

# Now build with your preferred build tool, e.g. maven
$ ./mvnw clean verify
```
